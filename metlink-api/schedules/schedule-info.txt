To get schedule info, I copied what the Metlink site does, which is the following in postman:

Performed a POST on https://backend.metlink.org.nz/api/v1/timetable
Had a JSON body of the following and would just update service:
{
  "service": "HVL",
  "start": "2024-04-02",
  "end": "2024-04-02"
}

{Linecode}-Schedule-Original.json holds the raw response from Metlink
{Linecode}-Schedule-Modified.json removes the extra cruft and just leaves the inbound and outbound arrays
data-source-schedules-{Linecode}.txt is the output code to copy into the TrainRunner app
