IRL Experiment:

Going from Wlg to Taita all stops on 21/02/2024:
- Arrived Epuni at 6:59pm, predicted time was 6:59pm (4 mins behind schedule). Live tracking said train arrived at 6:59pm
- By 6:59pm train left Epuni, Metlink live track updated during 7:00pm 
- Arrived at Wingate 7:04pm, predicted to be at 7.05 (4 mins behind schedule). Live tracking said train arrived at 7:04-7:05pm
- Arrived at Taita at 7:05pm, predicted time was 7:08 (4 mins behiund schedule). Live tracking said train arrived ~7:06pm


Verdict:
